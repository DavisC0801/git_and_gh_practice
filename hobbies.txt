I was an indoor kid growing up, and I guess I still am. I'm more social now so that's a plus, but my main hobbies are still playing video games, board games and tabletop RPG's.

I've gotten a little better being outside now that I'm in Colorado, so weather permitting I try to take at least a little time to walk around the nearby trails or go for a hike if I have a few hours free.
