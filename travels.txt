I'm very fortunate to have a travel buddy now. Most recently my partner and I went on a trip to Moab, Utah over Thanksgiving break, which was a place I've never been.

The majority of our trip was hiking, we went through the entire primitive trail at Arches national park, as well as a backpacking trip into Canyonlands national park. I've never been backpacking before, so it was a struggle to carry in a hundred pounds of gear and water, but a fantastic experience.
